# porfolio-v1
First attempt at a portfolio website.

Created with HMTL, Materialize CSS framework, CSS and Javascript.

First I created some designs in Figma to come up with a layout and plan. I knew I wasn't going to stick to the design 100%, but I wanted something to start with.

I then found Materialize CSS framework and wanted to use it to learn it, so thought why not try it out on my own portfolio. 

After some reading of the documentation and some general research via google I worked out how it all worked and how to initialize the Javascript functions within Materialize.
